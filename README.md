# 🚀 Project Around Express

## 📖 About the Project

**Around Express** is a backend project designed to provide **user and card data** via **GET requests**. This project serves as the foundation for a future **fully functional and visually appealing frontend**.

### Features:
- **Node.js & Express**: Handles server-side logic efficiently.  
- **API Development**: Provides user and card data through **RESTful API endpoints**.  
- **File System Operations**: Reads and writes data using the `fs` module.  
- **MongoDB & Mongoose**: Enables database interactions for storing and managing data.  

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal of this project is to develop a **server-side application** using **Express.js**, while reinforcing concepts of **backend development, RESTful APIs, and database integration**. It lays the groundwork for future enhancements, including a **fully functional frontend**.

## 🚀 Outcome

For now, the project **sets up a server and provides user and card data via GET requests**.  
In future updates, the **frontend will be integrated**, making the platform fully interactive.
